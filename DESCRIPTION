Description: >
    Decompose a user-provided and benchmark time series into seasonal, trend,
    and idiosyncratic components, then compute the ratio of the user trend
    to the benchmark trend. Provides methods to forecast the trend ratio
    (via exponential smoothing, SARIMA, Holt-Winters, and naive) and to
    generate 1-step-ahead user-series predictions. Supports MA(6/12),
    X-13ARIMA-SEATS, HP filter, STL, LOESS, and Prophet. Uses an R6 class API
    and ggplot2 for visualization.
Depends: R (>= 4.0)
